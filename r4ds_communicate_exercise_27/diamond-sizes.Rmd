```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

In this chart we observe a number of spikes, indicating that diamonds tend to have discrete number of carats. I.e., whatever are the process involved in diamond production, they tend to default to certain levels of carat. For instance, instead of making a 0.98 or 1.02 carat diamond, one can probably choose to make it 1.0 carat. Other explanation would be the measurement method, that could default to 1.0 even for actual 0.98-1.02 carat diamonds. Enough of nonsense.
